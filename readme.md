# Basic Face Detection Using OpenCV

This is an implementation of Image detection using OpenCV Library.
This repository contains two separate files for face detection through both Images and Webcam live face detection. The Haarcascade Frontal Face XML File has been used as a pre-trained model. Haarcascades also have a wide range of pre trained models that can be directly used to forge out the results from the model.

As the xml file used in this current project was trained 10 years ago, the accuracy of detection is not as good as we see in current times. Feel free to use different xml files that have been trained recently and perfectly.

## How to use the project

Download the zip/tar file from the github and extract it. Open the extracted folder using any code editor or any IDE of your choice. Install the requied libraries for the project and make changes in the file paths if requied(in case of face detection using image).
Now you an directly run the python file for the output.
